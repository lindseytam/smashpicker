# Smash Picker

Smash picker is a web app that randomly generates Smash Bros Ultimate characters based on theme and number of players.

This app was inspired by our indecisiveness at choosing characters, especially in the online mode where the random character option does not exist. In addition, we enjoy choosing random characters by theme, which is a fun feature we added for this project.

If you would like to learn more about the motivation behind this project and how it was made, please check out this [article](https://medium.com/@lindseytam/making-a-random-generator-for-super-smash-bros-68e826f37ef4) I wrote about the process.
